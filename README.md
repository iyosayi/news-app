## Overview

[Video Demo Link](https://www.loom.com/share/598636faa9d6478bad33c2e35072a7ac)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot, video recordings or a gif. Try to tell us about the solution you built by answering the following:

- Where can I see your demo?
 The demo can be viewed on this link [NewsApp](https://dabatech-news.netlify.app/)

It was a great one, I enjoyed doing this exercise. Although I encountered issues with the news API online (cors-error). I was able to fix this by self-hosting my own cors server.
